### formatting

Whenever we receive back information from the agent, we want to break it down in a way that makes it easy for the user to interact with.

We want it broken down into a number of sections 1 through 4, and if there are more than 4 sections, we should display a 5th option to display more sections.

Example:

Page 1

- 1: (Section 1) Introduction EM Role Is Tougher Than Ever
- 2: (Section 2) EM as a “Bridge” Between Worlds
- 3: (Section 3) Key EM Responsibilities
- 4: (Section 4) Team Building & Hiring
- 5: More options...

Page 2

- 1: (Section 5) Challenges of the Role
- 2: (Section 6) Industry Trends & Pressures
- 3: (Section 7) Advice for Modern EMs
- 4: (Section 8) Conclusion
- 5: Go back a page
